# Weekend Project ERROR Pages Copy

## Description

(ðŸ‘‰ ï¾Ÿãƒ®ï¾Ÿ)ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ‘ˆ(ï¾Ÿãƒ®ï¾Ÿ ðŸ‘ˆ)

In this project I created an imitation of Pixar and Dropbox error pages as part of my first weekend project in appleseeds bootcamp.

I used HTML for building the web page and CSS for styling. In the "Pixar" and "Dropbox" folders I used float for positioning and formatting content, and in "Pixar-additional styling" I used position for this purpose. Moreover, For the last I added the dropdown menu.

In order to achieve a responsive web page in Pixar project I used media query and set the max width to the appropriate size.

In the future I want to implement a hamburger menu, which will appear at the right side of the page when the size of the screen decrease and reaches a specific value. This element will contain all the links from the navigation bar.
